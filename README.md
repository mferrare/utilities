## Usage

### Running Scripts

Scripts are located in the `scripts/` directory. Make sure scripts are executable:

```bash
chmod +x scripts/script_name.sh
./scripts/script_name.sh
```

### Adding New Scripts

1. Add your script to the `scripts/` directory
2. Make it executable: `chmod +x scripts/your_script.sh`
3. Add appropriate comments and documentation within the script
4. Update this README if the script requires special setup or dependencies

### Example Script

The `scripts/example_script.sh` serves as a template for creating new utility scripts:

```bash
./scripts/example_script.sh --help
```
